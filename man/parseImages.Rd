\arguments{
\item{nuc}{An \code{Image} object or list of such objects representing
nuclear images. If the second argument (\code{tgt}) is \code{NULL},
this must be a list of length 2 containing nuclear and target images.}

\item{tgt}{An \code{Image} object or list of fluorescent images corresponding
to the nuclear images in \code{nuc}. If this argument is \code{NULL},
\code{nuc} is treated as a list of both image types.}

\item{nMask}{An optional \code{Image} object or a list of
these objects containing an integer \code{Image} mask identifying nuclei.
If this value is \code{NULL}, the nuclear mask will be determined by
\code{\link{nucMask}} with the arguments provided in \code{args.nMask}.}

\item{cMask}{An optional \code{Image} object or a list of 
these objects containing an integer \code{Image} mask identifying
regions of the target image in which to define cell boundaries. If 
\code{TRUE}, the nuclear mask will be used to generate an expanded mask
with \code{\link{cellMask}}. This larger mask will be used to measure
fluorescence intensity in the target image. If \code{FALSE} (default),
the nuclear mask will be used to measure fluorescence intensities.}

\item{args.nMask}{A list of arguments passed to \code{\link{nucMask}}.
This argument is ignored if a \code{nMask} is provided.}

\item{args.trimMask}{A list of arguments passed to \code{\link{trimMask}}.
This argument is ignored if a \code{nMask} is provided. Otherwise, if
\code{NULL}, \code{\link{trimMask}} will be called with default parameters.
If \code{FALSE}, no trimming will be performed.}

\item{equalize}{If the background varies significantly among the fluorescent
target images (or among the frames of target images), when \code{TRUE},
this option adjusts the fluorescent target images to have a common
background value with the default options in \code{\link{bnormalize}}
and using the entire range of target images for the expected range.}

\item{simplify}{Return a single \code{data.frame} of results if \code{TRUE},
otherwise return a list of \code{data.frames} for each member of the list.}
}
\value{
A data.frame (or list of data.frames) containing  processed image
data. \strong{Each} data.frame will have the following variables:
\describe{
  \item{\code{frame}}{Image sequence within each level of well
    or file as an \code{integer} (1, 2, 3, ...)}
  \item{\code{xm, ym}}{Center of mass (in pixels) for nucleus.}
  \item{\code{area}}{Area of the mask (in pixels) used to calculate target mfi.}
  \item{\code{dna}}{Mean fluorescence intensity for DNA stain,
    typically not meaningful if the DNA image was over-exposed.}
  \item{\code{mfi}}{Mean fluorescence intensity for the target,
    measured with selected mask.}
}
Results from data organized by \strong{well} will also include:
\describe{
  \item{\code{label}}{Harmonized, original well label}
  \item{\code{plate}}{From optional prefix (if present)}
  \item{\code{well}}{Harmonized well identifier from the
    \code{\link{well.info}} function}
  \item{\code{row}}{Row identifier ("A", "B", "C", etc.) as a factor}
  \item{\code{column}}{Column number as a factor}
}
Results from data organized as multi-layered tiff files (or stacks)
will include:
\describe{
  \item{\code{file}}{The file name as a factor.}
}

\description{
Identify nuclei by a DNA stain and measure the fluorescence intensity of
the DNA and a second second fluorescent target image from paired images.
}
\details{
This function identifies cells by a DNA stain and measures the
fluorescent intensity in both the DNA image and the paired fluorescent image.
This is part of a suite of tools implemented with \code{\link{EBImage}}
designed to determine viral titers from sets of fluorescent micrographs.
The first argument to this function can be the result of the function
\code{\link{getImages}}. Images provided to this function are paired where
the first of each pair is a DNA image and the second is a fluorescent image
of the viral antigen. Because individual cells are identified by the nuclear
stain, it is often beneficial to collect overexposed DNA images.

These tools were developed to process fluorescent virus titers
performed in multi-well plates and is designed to parse images
collected at different multiplicities of infection or moi. The
moi can be expressed as virions (VP) per cell \emph{or} infectious
units (IU) per cell \emph{or} a unit of volume (ml, ul, nl) per cell.
These details are added to output of this function with the
\code{\link{mergePdata}} function. Images must be ordered with the nuclear
(typically DAPI) image before the viral antigen image. Note that this
sequence can be adjusted with \code{which.images} argument in
the function \code{\link{getImages}}.

Images associated with each moi can be individual files in a
single directory where each directory is named for the well such as
\code{A1}, \code{A2}, etc. and the files within are identified as
\code{A1/file001.tif}, \code{A1/file002.tif}, etc. The well identifier
can be in upper or lower case and can contain leading zeros such as
\code{c0003/file12.tif}/ The well identifier also can contain a leading
alphanumeric prefix such as \code{1A2} or \code{02h012}.

Alternatively, each group of images associated with a given moi can be
a multi-layered tiff file where the sequence of images in the file is
specified by the argument \code{which.images}.

A unique ID for each image can be created from a combination of
\code{frame} and either \code{label}. This can be useful
if it is necessary to determine a separate background value for each
pair of images.
