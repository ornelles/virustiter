\title{Extract ID, Prefix, Well, Row and Column Label}
\usage{
well.info(w, format = NULL, upper = TRUE, drop.levels = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{Label (tag) for the well (coerced to a character).}

\item{format}{Character string as \code{\link{sprintf}} format for the
column, default value of \code{NULL} pads the column value with zeros
as needed such as \code{"\%02d"} for more than 9 columns.}

\item{upper}{to use upper case when \code{TRUE}.}

\item{drop.levels}{\code{logical} value to drop unused levels in
\code{row} and \code{column}.}
}
\value{
A named list of length three or five. Values for \code{tag} and
\code{prefix} will be returned only if a plate prefix is used. 
\itemize{
 \item tag, harmonized character representation of the entire well name
   including any prefix if present, otherwise this is not returned
	\item prefix, prefix as a character string if present, otherwise
   this is not returned
	\item well, harmonized well name as a factor
	\item row, row as a factor with levels A-P (or a-p)
	\item column, column number as a factor with levels 1-24
}
}
\description{
Create a uniform representation for a multi-titer well with an optional 
prefix extracted as prefix
}
\details{
This function will parse the \code{character} string in \code{w}
into an optional "harmonized" tag with an arbitrary prefix used to
identify the plate, followed by a single character for the well,
followed by the  column number formatted as per \code{format}.
The code will fail if the row  value is not one of the 16 letters from
A to P or if the column number is not in the range of 1 to 384.

The prefix must contain only alphanumeric characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z), the
underscore character, or the hyphen.

This function is also used to \emph{harmonize} well information generated
by different processes that may differ by the lower or upper case or the
use of leading zeros for the column number.

\examples{
  well.info("a6") # default settings
  well.info("a6", format = "\%d", upper = TRUE)
  well.info("Plate_2b92", format = "\%05d")
  well.info("Plate_2b92", format = "\%05d", drop.levels = FALSE)

}
